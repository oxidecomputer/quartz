# Quartz project status and open source

The Quartz repo is (and any associated repos are) public because

1. It has always been our intention to make this open-source.
2. We figured it's best to err on the side of doing this early instead of late.

The associated projects and IP are under development, and are not guaranteed to be
stable. It's probably not a good fit for your use case.

And so, we thought it was important to explain where we're currently at, and
manage your expectations.

- We are a small company.

- Our current goal is to get our current generation products finished and in
  customers' hands.

- We're writing IP and projects here in support of that goal, not as its own thing. 
  We have no dedicated community-support engineers -- we're all working on the products, and
  this development is a side effect.

- These points together mean that we may not have enough bandwidth to review and
  integrate outside PRs right now. This may change in the future.

You're welcome to send PRs! If we have time, or if the PRs are very small or fix
bugs, we may even integrate them in the near future. But be aware that we might
not get to it for a while, by which time it might no longer be relevant.

We've all dealt with those open source projects that feel open in name only, and
have big patches and history-free source drops appearing from behind the walls
of some large organization. We don't like that, and we're not going to do that.
But please bear with us while we're scaling up.

If you want to ask about whether a PR is consistent with our short-term plan
_before_ you put in the work -- and you should! -- hit us up on the repo
Discussions tab on GitHub.

Thanks!
