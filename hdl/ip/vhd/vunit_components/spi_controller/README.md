These represent a "vendoring" of the files from 
https://github.com/VUnit/vunit/pull/1041/files
a PR that hasn't merged into VUnit proper. Rather
than write our own, or continue waiting, we've pulled
them in here and will adjust/deprecate/remove when/if
the PR finally lands in VUnit or VUnit figures out what
to do with the impending "verification component restructure"
