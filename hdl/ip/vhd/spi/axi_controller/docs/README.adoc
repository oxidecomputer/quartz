It supports Mode 0 (0,0) and mode3 (1,1) transfers. It is expected that there are fewer than 256 addressable registers, but weâ€™re picking 16bit addressing for future extensibility without changing the protocol and to support a circular buffer for storing event history.

|Opcode| Instruction Name | Description| Notes
| 0x0 | Write byte(s)      | Write one or more contiguous bytes | 
| 0x1|  Read byte(s)      | Read one or more contiguous bytes|
| 0x2| Bit set | hardware does a bit-wise OR with data and current register state | new_reg = old_reg \|\| data
| 0x3| Bit clr | hardware does a bit-wise clear with data and current register state |new_reg = old_reg && !data
|===

Note that for the bit-set and bit-clear spi instructions, the AXI controller internally does a read-modify-write operation, resulting
in a read of the current register state, a bitwise operation with the data, and a write back of the new register state.  These are
not good operations to use if the registers you're modifiying have read-side effects.
