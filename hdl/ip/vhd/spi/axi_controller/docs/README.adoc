It supports Mode 0 (0,0) and mode3 (1,1) transfers. It is expected that there are fewer than 256 addressable registers, but weâ€™re picking 16bit addressing for future extensibility without changing the protocol and to support a circular buffer for storing event history.
Note that while we deal with byte addresses on the spi-side, the axl-lite protocol defines a minimum size of 32bits for the data bus, so peripherals
on the axi-side of this controller must respect wstrobe (byte enables), and caution should be exercised with registers that have read side effects because the whole
32bit register is fetched even if the spi block only needed 8bits of it.

|Opcode| Instruction Name | Description| Notes
| 0x0 | Write byte(s)      | Write one or more contiguous bytes (internal byte address increments) | 
| 0x1|  Read byte(s)      | Read one or more contiguous bytes|
| 0x2| Bit set | hardware does a bit-wise OR with data and current register state | new_reg = old_reg \|\| data
| 0x3| Bit clr | hardware does a bit-wise clear with data and current register state |new_reg = old_reg && !data
| 0x5| Write bytes(s) no increment | Write one address location one or more times (internal byte address does not increment)
| 0x6| Read bytes(s) no increment | Read one address location one or more times (internal byte address does not increment)
